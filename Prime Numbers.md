ending = int(input("choose an ending number: "))  
  
for i in range(starting, ending+1):  
    for j in range(2, i):

          break  
    else:  
       print(i)

  
  
#first loop is needed to iterate through original numbers  
#the second loop is needed to iterate the chosen number i through all of the numbers within the given limit
